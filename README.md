Yet Another Bad (Programming) Language

This is my attempt at making a programming language.
Written in c++ because why not.
Hopefully it will be compiled, but that's probably not gonna happen - So i'll develop it as an interpreted language first.
Basically, i wan't to try to make something atleast somewhat functional, that's the goal.
Currently the lexer works
